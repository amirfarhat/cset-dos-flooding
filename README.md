# CSET DoS Flooding Paper
This repository holds code, data, and documentation for [the paper we published in CSET 2022](https://doi.org/10.1145/3546096.3546105).

# Code
All the scripts and code we used to generate figures, tables, and numbers are in the [scripts]() directory.

# Data
Some of the data we used is in the [data]() directory, while the raw data can be found in the [experiments]() directory. Due to storage constraints, we do not store raw experiment files in the git repo. Instead, we host the data [on zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6828809) and provide scripts in the [experiments]() directory to download and process experiments from scratch.
